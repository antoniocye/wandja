This is the README of the Academic Center website, by the association Communauté Mathématique (CMath), in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.

The website was created by Antonio Kambiré, the founder of the association who is assuming the responsabilities of president from 2020 to 2023.
It is part of an effort to make CMath more well-known by providing a platform where people could have access to information about it online.
It also provides a platform where users can upload or view resources in French for preparation to mathematics and science contests.
